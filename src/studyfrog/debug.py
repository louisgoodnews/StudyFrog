    Entry point for running debugging, testing, or temporary development code.

    This function is typically executed only when the module is run directly
    (i.e., when `if __name__ == "__main__":` is true). It should contain logic
    for unit testing, integration testing, application setup validation,
    or quick ad-hoc testing during development.
